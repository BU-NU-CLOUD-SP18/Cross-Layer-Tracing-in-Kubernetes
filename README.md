# Cross-Layer-Tracing-in-Kubernetes
Cross-Layer Tracing in Kubernetes

## Vision & Goals
We will implement end-to-end tracing for Kubernetes on the data-plane. This includes instrumenting one or more subsystems within the Kubernetes structure.  As data-plane features become a part of the flow and behavior of an application, implementing trace points within them allows for a cross-layer, enabling a complex and deeper understanding of an applicationâ€™s behavior.  If issues come up in a distributed cluster operated by Kubernetes, tracing is an idea method to resolve said issues.
